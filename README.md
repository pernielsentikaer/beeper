# Beeper Raycast Extension

**This is pretty much work in progress and depends on an unreleased version of Beeper Desktop**

Manage Beeper Desktop with Raycast. Uses the [Beeper Desktop API TypeScript SDK](https://developers.beeper.com/desktop-api-reference/typescript/) with PKCE authentication.

See the [Beeper Desktop API Getting Started guide](https://developers.beeper.com/desktop-api/#get-started) for setup instructions.
